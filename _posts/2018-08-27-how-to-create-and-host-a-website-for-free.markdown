Nowadays, creating your own website is a relatively simple task. Gone are the days of learning HTML and figuring out how to host a website on a server. Now there are a multitude of website-building services such as Wix, Squarespace, and Weebly. Even if you're not tech-saavy and just need to quickly build a website, these options can be very enticing given their drag-and-drop user interfaces, variety of sleek designs, and simple deployment options.

However, the huge downsides to these website-building services is that they can be quite costly over time ($5-$25 per month depending on your feature set) and if you ever want to migrate your website to your own server or another website builder, you are basically starting from scratch. 

In addition, even if you choose the cheapest or free plans that these services offer, they require you to display ads promoting their service on your website (which looks very unprofessional), and they offer bare-bones features such as low storage and bandwidth caps, the inability to display video on your website, and no tools to track and analyze your website traffic.

What if I told you there was a way to build and host your own website absolutely for **FREE** and you can use your own custom designs, embed video, and have advanced features like tools to analyze your website traffic.

And when I say **FREE**, I'm saying building the website is **FREE** and ongoing hosting of the website is **FREE**. If you're thinking this is too good to be true, think again! By using free services such as Github Pages, Jekyll, Google Analytics, and YouTube you can create your own feature-rich website and host it for **FREE**!

## Getting Started with Github Pages and Jekyll

Now for my non tech-saavy readers, I'm sure when you hear something like Github, you may think it's too complicated to use or it's a service only for techie programmers. Now it's true that Github is huge in the software development world, and is the de facto method to gain version control over your code, back up your software projects to the cloud, and share your code with other programmers. 

However, a little known feature to Github is that it allows you to host your own personal website absolutely for free (no monthly fees, no startup fees, just **FREE**). It's done through Github Pages, which is way to host a website directly on Github, and Jekyll, a static-site generator that allows to covert plain-text into feature rich web pages.

Now there is a bit of a learning curve to using Github and Jekyll. For example, you have to use Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) to get the project started and make updates, but once you've done it a few times, it becomes very second nature. And if you're still thinking it's not worth to learn, think about $100-$400 you're spending per year to use Wix or SquareSpace and whether you want that money back in exchange for a **FREE**, fully customizable, and more feature-rich website-building solution.

Rather than explain step-by-step on how to set up Github Pages and Jekyll, I highly encourage you to watch the video above or follow [**Github Page's official instructions**](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
